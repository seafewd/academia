Deliverable 3

* Introduction

	This document describes the tasks to be performed for, and the constituents
of, the Deliverable 3. Such a document would usually not exist in a real
project documentation. (Similar information would be found elsewhere, for
example, in the Iteration Plan document, however.)

		[Note:]	Do not edit or modify this document. This document is
				managed by your lecturer.


* Goals

	The goals for this sprint are (some of them are similar to the ones of the preceding sprints):

	*	To organize a sprint in terms of product backlog, sprint backlog/tasks

			*	Product backlog organization

			*	Tasks and task allocations.

			*	Team collaboration.

			*	Working with Git (branches, team efforts, merging, ...)

	*	To commit to tasks and to complete them.

	*	To deliver a well-structured software in terms of good layering and package design.

	*	To deliver working object persistence.

	*	To deliver working user interface based on Vaadin.

	*	To deliver tested code for everything beyond the UI layer.

* Your Tasks

	With respect to Git, you work as described in {{{./s1.html}Sprint 1}}.
	These are the effective task you'll have to provide for this sprint:

	*	Organize your product backlog (PL, as in previous sprints):

			* PL item prioritization

			* PL item grooming

			* PL item "best-guess" estimation

	*	Organize your sprint:
	
			* Fix the list of PB items for this sprint

			* Split larger PB items into tasks

			* Provide task "best-guess" estimations

	*	Update any documents you have so far, if needed

			* Provide a system sequence diagram for the user stoy 'enroll to a module'

			* Provide a sequence diagram for the user stoy 'enroll to a module',
			  level of details: contoller(s), persistence layer

	*	Structure your code in packages by respecting the SOLID and Coupling design principles

			* Avoid cycles among Java packages

			* Provide A-I graph

	*	Provide object persistence with JPA

	*	Provide code for selected user stories

			* Production Java interfaces and classes

			* Vaadin UI support

			* JUnit test classes for the application logic and persistence

	[]


* Components of this Deliverable

	The deliverable for this sprint shall encompass:

	*	The product backlog at the beginning of the sprint

	*	The sprint backlog items / task list
	
	*	The list of finished sprint backlog items / tasks

	*	Design documentation

	*	Production Java interfaces and classes

			* JavaDoc documentation for public methods of entities and controllers

	*	Production Vaadin UI code

	*	Production Vaadin UI code linked to the application logic and persistence

	*	JUnit test classes, coverage: 95% (UI components excluded)

	*	Checkstyle report: No errors.

	[]


* Evaluation

	50 points at most per team member are attributed to this deliverable. Points may
	not be equally distributed among team members. (However, this is the goal.)
