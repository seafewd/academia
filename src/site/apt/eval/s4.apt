Deliverable 4

* Introduction

	This document describes the tasks to be performed for, and the constituents
of, the Deliverable 4. Such a document would usually not exist in a real
project documentation. (Similar information would be found elsewhere, for
example, in the Iteration Plan document, however.)

		[Note:]	Do not edit or modify this document. This document is
				managed by your lecturer.


* Goals

	The goals for this sprint are similar as the ones for sprint 3:

	*	To organize a sprint in terms of product backlog, sprint backlog/tasks:

			*	Product backlog organization

			*	Tasks and task allocations

			*	Team collaboration

			*	Working with Git (branches, team efforts, merging, ...)

	*	To commit to tasks and to complete them.

	*	To deliver a well-structured software in terms of good layering and package design.

	*	To deliver working object persistence.

	*	To deliver working user interface based on Vaadin.

	*	To deliver tested code for everything beyond the UI layer.

	*	To document your solution.

	[]

	The main difference to the preceding sprints is that you try to estimate your chosen product
backlog items and sprint tasks. Use a relative unit, and then try to calibrate it (e.g., assign
hours) as soon as you'll have finished the first task.


* Your Tasks

	With respect to Git, you work as described in {{{./s1.html}Sprint 1}}.
	These are the effective task you'll have to provide for this sprint:

	*	Organize your product backlog (PL, as in previous sprints):

			* PL item prioritization

			* PL item grooming

			* PL item "calibrated" estimation

	*	Organize your sprint:
	
			* Fix the list of PB items for this sprint

			* Split larger PB items into tasks

			* Provide task estimations in hours

	*	Update any documents you have so far, if needed

	*	Structure your code in packages by respecting the SOLID design principles

	*	Analyze your resulting package structure; provide A-I graph

	*	Provide object persistence with JPA

	*	Provide code for selected additional user stories

			* Production Java interfaces and classes

			* Vaadin 8 UI support

			* JUnit test classes for the application logic and persistence

	[]


* Components of this Deliverable

	The deliverable for this sprint shall encompass:

	*	The product backlog at the beginning of the sprint

	*	The sprint backlog items / task list
	
	*	The list of finished sprint backlog items / tasks and measurements of your efforts (in hours)

	*	Production Java interfaces and classes

			* JavaDoc documentation for public methods of entities and controllers

	*	Production Vaadin UI code

	*	Production Vaadin UI code linked to the application logic and persistence

	*	Run <<<mvn clean package site>>> and check the following reports (and act accordingly):

			* The test coverage (JaCoCo) report (95% code coverage beyond UI packages/classes)

			* The JDepend report (no cycles allowed; respect the Stable Dependency Principle
			  and the Stable Abstractions Principle). Adjust JDepend properties file <<<./jedpend.properties>>>
			  in the root of your project tree accordingly

			* The Checkstyle report (no errors allowed)

	*	Run <<<mvn [clean package] tomee:run>>> and play with your application by directing
		your browser to <<<http://localhost:8080/academia>>> or <<<http://localhost:8080/academia-\<project-color\>>>>

	[]


* Evaluation

	100 points at most per team member are attributed to this deliverable. Points may
	not be equally distributed among team members. (However, this is the goal.)
