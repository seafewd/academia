Deliverable 1


* Introduction

	This document describes the tasks to be performed for, and the constituents
of the Deliverable 1. Such a document would usually not exist in a real
project documentation. (Similar information would be found elsewhere, for
example, in the Iteration Plan document, however.)

		[Note:]	Do not edit or modify this document. This document is
				managed by your lecturer.


* Goals

	Deliverable 1 simulates the very first sprint according to Scrum. Hence,
the project finds itself in a very early stage of the whole development process.
An initial version of the project's {{{../doc/vision.pdf}Vision}} document exists only.

	The goals of the provisioning of Deliverable 1 are:

	* To think about stakeholders;

	* To think about and articulate first and most important user stories;

	* To think about and illustrate a domain model.

	*	Organize your product backlog (PL):

			* PL item prioritization

			* PL item grooming

			* PL item "best-guess" estimation

	*	Organize your sprint
	
			* Fix the list of PB items for this sprint

			* Split larger PB items into tasks

			* Provide task "best-guess" estimations

	[]


* Your Tasks

	Besides setting up your infrastructure (according to instructions given
by the lecturer), you work on the Deliverable 1. The constituents of D1
(short for Deliverable 1) are:

	[[1]]	A list of stakeholders; format: Name and
			brief description. Recommended place: the {{{../glossary.html}Glossary}}.

	[[]]		An initial set of user stories.

	[[]]		A context (use case) diagram.

	[[]]		A domain model. Domain classes (name, a few attributes at most, no
			operations), associations and multiplicities. No navigability indications.

	[[]]		A glossary.

	[[]]		Set up your personal programming environment.

	[[]]		Check out your initial project from GitLab.

	[[]]		(One team member only) Establish a new Git branch for this sprint.

	[[]]		(For every team member and every task) Establish a new Git branch for this
				task.

	[[]]		Provide initial classes.

	[[]]		Provide tests for your initial classes.

	[[]]		Merge your task branch into your sprint branch.

	[[]]		(At the end of the sprint, by one team member only) Merge the sprint
				branch into the master branch.

	[[]]		(At the end of the sprint, by one team member only) Tag the master branch.

	[]


* Components of this Deliverable

	Your deliverable will consist of your committed project on the Git master
branch. You will merge the deliverable from you development branch <sprint1>
(or <s1> if you prefer) to the master branch, set the POM's version number to
<1.0>, and tag it <del1>. Finally on the development branch <sprint2>, set the POM's version
number to <2.0-SNAPSHOT>.

	The constituents of your D1 shall consist of:

	[[1]]	A document consisting of:

			* The user stories;
			
			* The context diagram.

	[[]]		A Domain Model document (title, brief introduction, and the domain model).

	[[]]		The product backlog at the beginning of the sprint

	[[]]		The sprint backlog items / task list
	
	[[]]		The list of finished sprint backlog items / tasks

	[[]]		A set of stakeholders, preferably in the {{{../glossary.html}Glossary}}.

	[[]]		Initial working and tested domain classes: classes, attributes, and
				associations. Persistence in DB is optional, but recommended. Unit tests.

	[]

	Note that all documents and the source files must be committed and pushed to
the Git server being used.

Distribution of points for this deliverable.

	The (extension of the) glossary, all documents are well integrated into the
project documentation Web structure. If you don't use APT, then PDF files will do as well.
Ask your instructor for help if necessary.


* Deadline

	This deliverable is due: See {{{./sprints.html}Sprint Plan}}.

	[Note:]	Deadline is Friday evening. However, you can provide
			your deliverable till the following Sunday evening, 12 pm.
