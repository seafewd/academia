Product Backlog

    The product backlog is a list of user stories which is used to implement the product vision.
It is sorted according to the priority of the user stories according to the product owner.
The priority of these stories will be modified during the process of the project.

    Reflection of the (almost) past project:
In the beginning we had very much expectations what in our program has to be implemented. We underestimated the time for some points drastically,
some things we thought would be simple took 30 or more hours for us to work on. Especially the backend part took us very long, the most time
we spent there, the view for users was nowhere the most of the time. Other things that seemed like relatively time-expensive,
for example a PDF implementation of the enrollment list, were done very quickly. Even if we miscalculated the time in the most points
we learned in the process of the project to take more time to think things through carefully. We started to divide bigger tasks in very small ones
to not lose the overview.
